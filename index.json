However, this package is being deprecated in Unity 6.1. I wanted to use this similar system, but rewrite it using native C# code in the editor. This package uses the .dll from the Localization package for the Google Sheets API. (back to top) Getting Started This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. Prerequisites Create Project: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate Once the project is created, open the project in the dashboard. Then select APIS and Services -> Google Drive API, and enable this permission. While under the API & Services Page, select on the left Credentials->Manage Service Accounts and create a service account. Keep in mind to make this account the owner. Once the account is created, in the dropdown select Manage Keys then Add Key. For the key type, select JSON as this will be used in the Editor to verify the account. Share the spreadsheet to the email address created with the service account, with the editor role. Enable API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com Get Spreadsheet ID and the Sheet IDs from the URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[Your Spreadsheet ID Here]/edit?gid=[Your Sheet ID Here]]#gid=[Your Sheet ID Here]] Installation Use UPM to install the package via the following git URL: https://github.com/Bookfan97/YetAnotherGoogleSheetsPackageUnity.git or download and import the unity package manually.
